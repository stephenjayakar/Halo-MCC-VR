# Halo 3 native volume movement

September 6, 2026 UTC. This follows the user's request for comprehensive world
collision, with player collision as a reference, instead of isolated surface
patches. No replacement weapon solver or headset acceptance is claimed here.

## Pinned source and verified call shape

The official H3EK `halo3_tag_test.exe` SHA-256 is
`59A78F2C96034D7CEB5D710505B2B36813AA141FC81A083E3F952973DBCE4602`.
Retail `halo3.dll` SHA-256 is
`B209D8454B12DC77E54CCD2C9924EC8D44B8619D21CF98E36FFAF601E67EFB63`.
`tools/verify-h3-volume-movement.py` first runs the existing point/gather
verification, then checks the movement/solver instructions and a unique retail
solver entry. Output: `out/research/20260906-native-volume/verification.json`.

Official `6506C0` moves its incoming radius from XMM3 to the fifth stack
argument, zeroes XMM3, then calls `64EC20` at `650717`. This is the zero-height
(sphere) form of the previously identified movement query. Direct call sites
to the wrapper are `4DF7FC`, `5DFD6C`, `646E92`; direct calls to the full query
are `5DFDA2` and the wrapper. The `5DEE...` caller includes explicit
`physics/collision_debug.cpp` source records. The scanner checked call
instruction boundaries inside their unwind ranges and saved disassembly under
the output directory. These are direct-call observations, not an exhaustive
indirect-call graph. **A player movement connection is not established.**

The full query gathers around position plus half displacement and vertical
half-height. Search radius is half displacement length plus half-height plus
sphere radius. Gather receives height and sphere radius as separate arguments;
zeroing both, as in the empty-region probe, is not a swept-sphere query.

Official `64EE60` and retail `1FEF30` consume those gathered features. Official
assertions name `old_position`, `old_velocity`, `new_position`, `new_velocity`,
and the three feature categories sphere/cylinder/prism. The caller's empty
gather branch directly copies position + displacement and unchanged input
displacement to the two outputs. The matched solver call shape is:

```
uint16 solve(position*, displacement*, features*,
             new_position*, new_velocity*, uint16 maximum_count, records*)
```

The returned collision-record stride is 48 bytes in both modules. The official
debug caller supplies 14 slots; another native caller supplies 16. The probe
supplies 16 and checks a sentinel beyond all 16 records. The record fields are
not otherwise interpreted by this probe.

## Retail exclusion difference

Retail movement `1FFB64` writes -1 to the gather's first ignored-object argument
at `1FFC45`, unlike the official caller forwarding it. Invoking that convenience
wrapper near the player's own collider would therefore be inappropriate for a
weapon query that must exclude its owner. The probe calls the already verified
gather separately with explicit player exclusion, using the native construction
of search center/radius and the sphere radius argument, then calls the matched
solver. It uses structure + instance + object flags already evidenced in
`HALO3-CLEARANCE-QUERY-EVIDENCE.md`.

## Opt-in bounded native probe

`HALOMCCVR_H3_CONTACT_DEBUG_VOLUME=1` / harness `-Test wall -ProbeVolume` enables
32 observations at 250 ms spacing on surfaces discovered by the existing native
wall fixture. All work occurs on the gated simulation contact worker. The probe
does not change weapon poses, object movement, melee, camera ownership or hooks.

It tries four radii (3, 8, 16, 24 cm), and four motion cases: crossing from the
free side, moving away, crossing with tangential motion, and starting 2 cm inside
the reference plane. The normal is oriented toward the camera that found the
surface. Nearby geometry can constrain motion sooner than that reference plane;
the signed reference-plane clearance is evidence, not a complete pass metric.
Point interior status, gathered counts, solved position/velocity, collision
count, sentinel/finite checks, and query time are published into fixed records.
The existing cold logger formats them. Invalid bounds or a fault disables this
probe only. Normal launches leave it off.

The harness requires 32 bounded, fault-free observations. That is admission and
memory-layout validation, **not** proof of correct sweep response. Review the
positive, negative, sliding and interior cases before using results in the
weapon solver. Rotating whole-weapon coverage, latency, dynamic target response,
Guardian/Floodgate behavior, videos and headset acceptance remain outstanding.
